I had some issues trying to figure out my homepage design using bootstrap which wasn't very straight forward, I had about two other github pages created and then would transfer the codes that worked successfully in to a new one, but after attending the last worklab I understood some certain things better and had to start my website over again from scratch.
The Home page was the most challenging for me because it has elements that revolve around me using position-relative and position-absolute as well as taking my time to research which bootstrap documentation works. I tried using card documentation to set up the images section with the image sitting on the gradient backgrounds but i couldn't pull it off within the amount of time i had. 

I implemented the corrections you pointed out to me and i must say it made the website look much better. Another challenging aspect for me was also trying to get media queries for the Tablet and mobile version, it was easy getting the images to align. However, the navbar, text, footer did not comply.
I really wanted to include one animation atleast for my logo (shake on hover effect) or my adopt page (slide-in card) feature but couldnt. I would really love to finish up this website afterwards.

My Buttons and links are styled with hover and focus effects, which makes the site interactive and accessible.
The logo on all pages takes the user to the home page.
The footer includes quick links to important sections of the site and social media icons for further engagement.
